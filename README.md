Following anti-tourism protests in Spain in July 2024, an analysis of the Spanish tourism industry was activated. 
The data analysis sought to investigate trends in the Spanish tourism sector from 1995 to 2022. All data files were 
sourced from the archives of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation which serves as a global tourism repository for 
UN registered countries. 

Data extraction, cleaning and processing was conducted accordingly. 

The final report titled "Sustainable Tourism Report" is attached in the repository. 
Explore r-codes used for the project in the final Rmarkdown file as accordingly attached
for analytical validation. All independent graphs and plots are also attached. 

Have fun exploring our repository !!!
